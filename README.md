Calendux by James Kearney

## Introduction:
Calendux is a Linux-based calendar/notification system designed to provide a customizable and efficient way to manage schedules and events. With the ability to connect to Google Calendar and provide a streamlined user interface, Calendux aims to simplify the process of managing and organizing events on Linux.

## Project Goals:
- Calendar application is able to be run through the shell: Calendux will be designed as a command-line application that can be easily run through the Linux shell
- Users can add/delete/edit tasks on the calendar: Calendux will allow users to easily add, delete, and edit tasks on the calendar, providing flexibility and control over their schedule.
- Integration with Google Calendar: Calendux will utilize Google's API to connect with Google Calendar, allowing users to load events from their Google Calendar directly into the application.
- Full calendar view of months, weeks, and days: Calendux will provide a comprehensive calendar view that allows users to see their events for months, weeks, and days at a glance, providing a clear overview of their schedule.
- List of activities for certain days: Calendux will provide a feature to display a list of activities for specific days, making it easy for users to view their events for a particular day in a concise and organized manner.
- Notifications for upcoming events: Calendux will send notifications for events that are about to start soon, ensuring that users are reminded of their upcoming events in a timely manner.

## How Calendux is different:
Calendux aims to provide a unique and customizable calendar/notification system for Linux users. By leveraging Google's API, Calendux will provide seamless integration with Google Calendar, allowing users to sync their events and interact with their calendar using custom controls through the command-line interface. This will enable users to efficiently manage their schedule and save time compared to using traditional calendar interfaces.
